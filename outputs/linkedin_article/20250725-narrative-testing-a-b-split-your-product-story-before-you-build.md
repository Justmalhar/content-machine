# The Untold Step in Product Development: Story First

When we think about product development, especially in tech, the usual suspects are iteration, coding, and constant tweaking. Yet, there's a vital step that often hides in the shadows of the build phase—testing the story of your product before penning a single line of code.

# What Is Narrative Testing?

Before delving into how a feature works, let's think about how it feels. Narrative testing involves crafting various versions of your product's story and observing user reactions. It concerns less with functionality and more with resonance.

Take, for example, a ride-sharing app. Instead of jumping into backend tech, consider creating narratives highlighting different user experiences. Does your app make users feel safer, or does it prioritize speed? Each narrative touches different emotions and expectations.

# Why Use A/B Testing for Stories?

A/B testing, known in digital marketing for measuring the impact of web pages or features, can be applied to narratives to see which story resonates most.

Before building, try simple tests with landing pages, ads, or mockups. Present one version focusing on safety and another on efficiency. Track metrics like sign-ups or interest. Which story makes people click, share, or comment more?

# Building Empathy and Understanding

This method fosters empathy with users. It encourages stepping outside of technical specs to ponder the human experience. What challenges do users face, and how does your product solve them?

Your goal isn't just identifying the best story but understanding why it resonates. By iterating on narratives first, you gain insights into user motivations, laying a strong development foundation.

# Practical Steps to Narrative Testing

1. **Develop Story Variants:** Begin with different narratives, each highlighting unique user benefits or experiences.

2. **Create Simple Prototypes:** Use landing pages, social media ads, or short videos to depict your stories. Keep costs low; the objective is testing the narrative, not the product.

3. **Gather Feedback:** Utilize analytics to track engagement. Were users more interested in safety, speed, or convenience?

4. **Analyze and Adapt:** Refine your story based on insights. Perhaps users value transparency in pricing over speed. Adapt your narrative before the build phase.

5. **Iterate:** Narrative testing isn't a one-off exercise. As your product evolves, continually test new storylines to stay aligned with user needs.

# Avoiding Common Pitfalls

A common mistake is focusing solely on features. Instead, frame your narratives around the user journey. This subtle shift turns the spotlight from "what" the product does to "why" it matters.

Assuming an initial story is final is another pitfall. User preferences evolve over time, and so should your narrative.

# The Role of Narrative in Product Success

In today's competitive landscape, technology alone rarely acts as a differentiator. Success often stems from a product's ability to connect deeply with users.

By prioritizing narrative testing, you humanize your product from the onset. This provides a clearer vision and better-informed strategy, reducing the risk of building something users don't want.

# Conclusion

Testing narratives offers early insight into understanding the world from your user's perspective. Before the complexities of code and design take over, pause to ask: What story are we telling, and is it the one users long to hear?

Much like music, a well-tested narrative can feel like a soothing tune that matches the rhythm of users’ needs and aspirations. Start with a story, and the symphony of code and design will follow.
