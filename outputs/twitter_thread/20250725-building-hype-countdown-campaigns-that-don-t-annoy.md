Diversify your platforms. Use emails, social media, even offline methods like flyers or events. Consistency matters, but tailor messages for each platform. Instagram stories are for visuals; emails for detailed info.

Engage actively with your audience using polls, quizzes, and contests. Invite participation, turning passive viewers into active participants. Encourage user-generated content by having them share their experiences.
