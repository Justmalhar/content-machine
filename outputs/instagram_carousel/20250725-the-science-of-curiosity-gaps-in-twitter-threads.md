The Power of Curiosity Gaps

### Slide 2

Curiosity gaps keep us hooked. They create a need to know more, fueling our scrolls and clicks.

### Slide 3

Inside these gaps lies a psychological trigger, like the Zeigarnik Effect—our brain craves closure on unfinished tasks.

### Slide 4

Crafting these gaps isn’t about withholding; it’s a narrative dance. Start with intrigue, breadcrumb the path, and deliver resolution.

### Slide 5

But beware—balance is key. Avoid turning curiosity into empty clickbait. Inform, inspire, or entertain responsibly.
