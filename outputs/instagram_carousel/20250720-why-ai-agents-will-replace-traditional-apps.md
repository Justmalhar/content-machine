The Shift to AI Agents
---
We've relied on apps for years, each with its purpose, creating silos. AI agents promise a unified interface that changes everything.
---
Imagine planning a trip. An AI agent handles flights, hotels, and weather, presenting a complete plan based on your preferences. No app toggling needed.
---
AI agents prioritize experience over engagement, enhancing interactions quietly, like adjusting lights and suggesting breakfast, without demanding attention.
---
They learn and adapt, evolving with you. As your interests change, so does their assistance, providing a personalized experience without explicit commands.
---
AI agents integrate platforms, reducing the burden of app switching. They promise seamless, centralized control, maintaining privacy and user trust.
