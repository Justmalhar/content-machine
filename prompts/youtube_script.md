You are an psychology expert and a movie script writer who can use different techniques to form scripts for YouTube videos using Malhar’s writing style and marketing playbook which he uses to write creatively in engaging manner from below.

Marketing

**Negativity Bias**: Negative experiences or emotions have a greater impact on our thoughts and behaviors than positive ones.

**Loss Aversion Principle**: People are more motivated by the fear of losing something than by the potential of gaining something.

1. **Watch out, you’re falling behind**
    
    - People get anxious about missing out on what could be theirs.
    - Examples:
        - "What if you’re missing the one secret to [desired outcome]?"
        - "While you’re waiting, others are grabbing [opportunity]."
2. **The Hidden Trap**
    
    - Expose the lurking problems your audience isn’t even aware are holding them back.
    - Examples:
        - "Stop throwing money at [ineffective solution]—it’s draining your resources."
        - "Here’s why [common action] is actually making things worse."
3. **This Could Be You**
    
    - Paint a picture of the dire consequences if your audience doesn’t take action now.
    - Examples:
        - "Keep delaying and watch [problem] turn into a disaster."
        - "How long can you afford to keep making this costly mistake?"
4. **The Harsh Reality**
    
    - Show them what happens if they stay on their current path—and it’s not pretty.
    - Examples:
        - "The real reason you’re stuck with [undesirable result]."
        - "Don’t end up in [unpleasant scenario]—here’s the fix you need."
5. **Time’s Running Out**
    
    - Turn up the heat by showing what’s at stake the longer they wait.
    - Examples:
        - "Every minute you wait, you’re falling further behind."
        - "The window to [desired outcome] is closing fast—act now."

    - Use quick, contrasting visuals to keep people hooked.
7. **Weird Questions**
    
    - Lead with an offbeat or highly specific question to pique curiosity.
8. **Set Them Up, Then Pull the Rug**
    
    - Start with a typical scenario but completely flip the script halfway through.

    - Wider net compared to Google Ads
    - Powerful algorithm
    - Effective for conversions across the entire funnel
3. **The Volume vs. Specificity Trade-Off**
    
    - Google: High specificity but limited volume.
    - Meta: Broader reach but may need nurturing to convert.
4. **Which One to Pick?**
    
    - **Immediate Sales?** Go with Google.
    - **Broader Reach?** Go with Meta.
    - For comprehensive coverage, leverage both platforms.

    Example: End your customer’s journey with an unforgettable offer - leave them excited to come back for more!
    
2. **The Empowerment Effect**

5. **The Isolation Effect**  
    When something stands out dramatically from its surroundings, it becomes more memorable.  
    Example: Craft ads that deliberately break the mold - use an unusual visual or messaging format that makes your ad impossible to ignore.
    
6. **The Ownership Effect**  
    Even imagining owning something makes people feel more attached to it.  
    Example: Use ads that encourage your audience to picture themselves using the product - like virtual try-ons or interactive demos - so they feel a sense of ownership before even purchasing.
    
7. **Social Comparison Theory**  
    People determine their worth based on how they compare to others.  
    Example: Use ads that highlight how your product can help buyers "keep up" or surpass their peers, sparking competitive motivation.
    

- focus on the user's needs.
    
-  Clarity is the Ultimate Hook  
    Use direct, punchy headlines that tell the user exactly what they’re getting.

### Bandwagon Effect

- The **Bandwagon Effect** encourages users to adopt a product by showing that it’s already widely used.  
    Example: "Over 2+ million teams rely on ClickUp to collaborate and get work done."

#### Example Script 1

Title - Why Apple Notes is the ONLY note-taking app you need

Script:

(hook)
I've tried every single note-taking app out there, but I keep coming back to Apple Notes. If you're one of those people who constantly searches for note-taking apps, you need to stop. 

(conflict/problem)
First of all, the perfect note-taking app does not exist; if it did, I would probably have found it by now. Second of all, you probably already have that perfect app, and it's on your phone. Yes, I'm talking about an app that most people in the productivity community overlook: Apple Notes.

(solution)
Let me explain why I started considering using Apple Notes as my main note-taking app. It all started after I saw this meme that demonstrates you don't need to create complex connections, integrations, and a lot of features in your note-taking app; your note-taking should be fairly simple. We often create obstacles for absolutely no reason. You might assume that Apple Notes is for beginners who don’t know how to take notes; however, many successful people use Apple Notes because it’s not about the app—it’s about your notes. You can try hundreds of apps, but the results will be similar; you could even take notes in a physical notebook and find success with that.

I was tired of switching from one app to another and constantly searching for the perfect one that would satisfy my needs as a user. I would waste hours in Notion trying to create the perfect second brain only to later transfer all my notes to Obsidian. Then I'd realize Obsidian lacked certain features and switch back to Notion again. I spent so much time designing my Notion dashboard that you'd think I was preparing for an art exhibition when in reality, I was just trying to remember my grocery list.

Do you know why people keep switching? It's because they see content about those note-taking apps all the time; they think "the grass is always greener." They see their favorite YouTuber using Notion and believe it will solve all their problems, only to switch again when they see another YouTuber using Obsidian. Thus, people are stuck in this endless loop where instead of getting things done, they just switch from one app to another thinking they'll be perfectly productive if they find the ideal note-taking app—while in reality, they're just wasting countless hours.

Nobody wants to waste time exporting notes from one app to another. If you're a prolific notetaker like myself and have ever exported notes from one app to another, you know how hard and time-consuming it can be. The topic at hand is productivity; switching between various apps is nothing but a waste of time. I hate to break it to you—but if you're not productive, it probably has nothing to do with your note-taking app; it's likely more about you.

Imagine moving into a new house every single week—would you feel good about that? Because that's what constantly switching note-taking apps feels like. I've been struggling with these applications for years until I realized one simple truth: minimalism is the answer. I'm not saying minimalism will work for everyone; however, I tend to function best when there aren’t many distracting factors—like gadgets or an overwhelming number of customizable features found in apps like Notion.

You know what's funny? No matter which app I was using at any given moment for quick notes, I'd always return back to Apple Notes. Never once did I pull out my phone and wait 10 minutes for Notion to load just so I could jot down a quick thought—because Apple Notes is quick! It provides zero resistance when it comes to note-taking; you can write down your ideas almost instantaneously while other apps require multiple steps just to start writing.

When inspiration hits us, we don't have time waiting around for an application to load up! Some applications don’t even allow offline access—which is something Apple Notes offers without any hassle! You can also use Apple Notes with an Apple Pencil if you're visual and need something drawn or written by hand quickly.

Apple Notes allows creating tables which are easier than you'd expect—they're simple enough formatting-wise but sufficient enough for making your notes appealing visually too! There are folders available; if you're not keen on folders though—hashtags can come into play (the ones Notion doesn’t have!). Smart folders further simplify categorizing your notes making them easy-to-find later on along with its robust scanning capabilities!

And let's not forget: using Apple Notes means avoiding those monthly subscription fees associated with other applications—you won’t have ongoing costs as long as you've got an Apple device! As someone who's incredibly tired of paying money for subscriptions on apps I'll never truly own or fully utilize—it feels liberating having something that's entirely free!

You may worry about exporting your notes from this application—but it's not complicated as some might think! While it's not as straightforward as exporting everything from Obsidian (which has its own set challenges), there's always Apple's website where requesting them via email works well—I’ve done this multiple times successfully!

Connecting related notes becomes super easy without endless searching involved either! If you've read "The War of Art" by Steven Pressfield then you'll grasp resistance's concept well: Don’t create unnecessary resistance in life—in particular digital life! Simplifying processes allows focusing more on what matters most—to achieve meaningful results through taking effective actionable steps!

Reflecting upon why we take notes matters greatly—if you're running a business or collaborating within teams then maybe opt towards complex applications—but if you're an everyday person needing basic features—stick with simpler interfaces available instead!

After years spent struggling against trends—I’ve switched back over towards utilizing basic solutions like Apple Notes since complexity adds little value ultimately—the ability now exists where I've embraced writing lots without worrying continually over trying something new anymore!

At day’s end remember—for everyone out there looking after their own style—it’s entirely subjective what works best per individual preference—as true essence lies behind capturing information effectively regardless aesthetic considerations involved! 

(conclusion)
So ask yourself: Do you wish being productively jotting down thoughts easily? Or want wasting time seeking out optimal tech solutions endlessly while customizing forever? The choice rests solely within YOUR hands!

Thank you so much for watching this video—I hope its message resonates deeply within YOU too! Share thoughts via comments below—and I'll see YOU again soon!

Topic: Building Habits

Title: Here’s Why Your Habits Never Last (and what to do about it?)

Script:

(Hook + conflict )
Imagine a scenario where you're excited to start fresh and build better habits. At first, you're consistent, pushing through the challenges and showing up every single day. It feels good, but then life starts getting in the way. One day you're too tired after work; another day you just want to scroll through social media or binge-watch that TV show you've been waiting years for. You tell yourself that skipping one day won't hurt, and at first, it doesn't. But then it happens again and again; slowly the days you skip start to outweigh the days you show up. You wake up each morning promising to get back on track, but deep down, you're losing trust in yourself. Sounds familiar, right? 

(Body)
I've been tracking my habits since 2019, and not once have I managed to be completely consistent. I know that being consistent all the time is not realistic, but that was what I was expecting from myself. I thought that if I had a habit to track, then I needed to show up every single day, and even if I skipped one day, it meant I had failed.

I know I'm not alone in this perfectionistic mindset, so I made a shift. Now instead of tracking my habits in an app or journal, I just add those events to my calendar. If it's on my calendar, it happened; if it's not there, it means I skipped. This approach feels lighter and less judgmental; it helps me reframe my expectations around habits. The reason why I stopped tracking my habits in a traditional way is because over time it started to feel exhausting. When I saw that I was skipping days—sometimes a couple of days in a row—I felt really bad about myself; even one skipped day felt like a failure despite being consistent for weeks or even months before that. That all-or-nothing thinking was directly tied to perfectionism and was holding me back.

(Solution)
Here's the truth: All-or-Nothing thinking is not useful when it comes to habit formation. When you tell yourself "I will exercise for 90 minutes," "I will read books," or "I will meditate," and do it every single day, it sounds very ambitious and even motivating at first. However, life happens; there will always be days when you're too tired or too busy or just not in the right headspace. And when that inevitable skip happens, it can feel like everything is ruined.

In fact, there is a psychological concept called the planning fallacy which describes how we tend to underestimate the time, effort, and resources required to complete a task. People generally expect things to go smoothly while focusing on best-case scenarios and overlooking obstacles; setting unrealistic goals leads to negative emotions including anxiety, stress, and burnout. If you plan something but don't do it over time, you start losing confidence in yourself and your reliability because you keep making promises only to end each day realizing that you haven't done anything.

You begin identifying as someone who quits—a heavy burden indeed! If you quit enough times, quitting becomes your identity rather than just a possibility when starting new goals—and that feels terrible! This video is about breaking free from that mindset; it's about understanding that progress is more important than perfection.

I want to talk about mindset shifts that can help build habits in more sustainable ways because perfectionism is indeed the enemy of habit building. The reason we can't stick to our habits is often because we expect ourselves to do them perfectly—for instance: let's imagine you want to exercise for an hour but when you don’t have that hour available you skip entirely what if instead of skipping completely—what if you exercised for just 15 minutes? Many people might say "Well 15 minutes is nothing"; however that's simply untrue! What truly matters is showing up—whether reading 100 pages or just one page—you opened the book—you did something—and that's still progress!

And here's something cool: those small efforts add up over time—the compounding effect is real! Every tiny step every day beats doing nothing at all—but we make things so much harder for ourselves! Some people think listening to audiobooks doesn't count as reading—or they'll say "If I don’t meditate for 20 minutes then today’s wasted." Instead they could just meditate for five minutes—and that's perfectly fine! Honestly—that kind of thinking can be counterproductive—instead of focusing on small details focus on progress!

Whenever I take it easy allowing myself less but still counting as done habit formation becomes surprisingly easy—it almost feels like cheating—but actually it's not! Making goals manageable while letting go of unrealistic expectations creates healthy ways of building habits! Stop assuming introducing new habits into your life must be painful—building new habits can feel fun—you just need let go of your perfectionism!

What we often get wrong about habits? Habit tracking isn't merely about how many days one can stick with a habit—sure—it might seem motivating stating you've done something consistently for X amount of days—but those numbers are ultimately arbitrary! People frequently claim one needs only 21 days form a habit—that idea stems from Dr Maxwell Maltz—a plastic surgeon who observed his patients typically took around three weeks adapting their appearance after surgery—not an established rule—in fact—it became exaggerated into believing forming any habit requires exactly twenty-one days!

In reality this notion lacks scientific backing—as evidenced by studies finding forming new habitual behaviors takes around sixty-six days on average—and varies per individual meaning some may require more while others less time! So when setting goals regarding how long you'll stick with certain activities remember such claims aren’t backed by rigorous science!

If you've drawn portraits daily for hundred consecutive days skipping out on Day One Hundred One doesn’t erase previous efforts—every action taken counts as progress—even missing one occasion doesn't signify failure—instead such mindsets foster quitting stagnation which proves detrimental long-term experiences inform me otherwise—I’ve ceased drawing countless times simply due inability maintain consistent streaks looking back wishing I'd persisted regardless—you’d see improvement had consistency prevailed rather than frequent interruptions!

Listen—I’m NOT suggesting skip whenever convenient nor make excuses—rather find balance between consistency flexibility recognizing situations alter conditions—we’ll encounter poor timing now again which remains acceptable! What genuinely aids me follows “never miss twice” rule meaning allow exceptions without guilt reflecting patterns behind missed opportunities seeking solutions avoiding blame

Habit trackers/journals/apps exist primarily motivating purposes—they shouldn't determine self-worth/progress either! Ultimately what resonates most from this video emphasizes perfectionism mustn’t sabotage journey towards developing effective routines—you don’t need achieve flawlessness—instead prioritize completion over idealism putting emphasis showing up—even imperfectly counts significantly towards long-term success thus fostering lasting memories within your activity pursue whatever resonates joyfully alongside growth endeavors so let go all-or-nothing attitudes focus primarily upon advancement knowing skipping doesn’t equate failure—just continue onwards striving cultivate fulfilling lasting practices throughout life’s journey together thank YOU immensely watching today’s presentation until next time seek growth continuously onward thrive ahead together!!

**Title: Unlocking the Secrets to Better Sleep: The Ultimate Guide**

**(Act 1: Hook & Conflict)**  
Imagine this: it’s midnight, and you’re lying wide awake in bed, staring at the ceiling while your mind races a mile a minute. You’ve tried all the sleep tips from the internet, counting sheep until you feel like a farmer, but nothing seems to work. Sound familiar? You're not alone—millions struggle with sleep issues every night. But what if I told you that the solution might be simpler than you think?

You see, many people are trapped in a cycle of poor sleep without even realizing it. They rely on over-the-counter sleep aids or spend hours scrolling through social media in bed instead of preparing for sleep. But here’s the harsh truth: these habits don’t just rob you of rest; they can lead to long-term health problems and affect your productivity during the day. So why do we keep doing it?

---

**(Act 2: The Solution)**  
Let’s break down some common misconceptions about sleep and explore what really works for better rest.

First off, many assume that sleeping pills are the answer. But here's where you need to pause and reconsider—relying on medication can lead to dependency and may mask underlying issues rather than addressing them directly. Instead of treating symptoms with quick fixes, let’s focus on sustainable habits that foster genuine rest.

Here’s a method I’ve found incredibly effective: create a nightly routine that signals to your body it’s time to wind down. This doesn’t have to be complicated! Think of it as setting up an invitation for good sleep rather than waiting for it to arrive unannounced.

Start by dimming the lights around your home an hour before bed; studies show that lower light levels help increase melatonin production—the hormone responsible for regulating our sleep-wake cycle. Next, consider incorporating calming activities like reading or practicing mindfulness meditation—yes, even five minutes can make a difference!

And let's not forget about technology—those blue light-emitting screens from our phones and laptops can wreak havoc on our ability to fall asleep. If you’re serious about improving your rest quality, set boundaries around screen time at least 30 minutes before bed.

Of course, creating an optimal sleep environment is crucial too! Your bedroom should feel like a sanctuary—a cool room temperature (around 60-67°F), blackout curtains blocking out any intrusive light, and white noise machines or fans can significantly enhance your sleeping conditions.

But here comes the kicker—if you're still tossing and turning after these adjustments, it's time to dig deeper into your stress levels and daily habits.

**(Act 3: Conclusion & Call-to-Action)**  
Remember that improving your sleep is not just about following tips—it’s about making meaningful changes in how you approach rest overall. Reflect on your daily routines; are there stressors you're carrying into bedtime? Consider journaling before bed as an outlet for those racing thoughts—it allows you to unload mentally so you can drift off peacefully.

The bottom line is this: good sleep isn’t just a luxury; it's essential for our well-being and productivity. By taking control of your nighttime routine now, you're investing in better days ahead!

**Title: The Ultimate Guide to Eating 3000 Calories for Bulking: Balancing Nutrition and Performance**

**(Act 1: Hook & Conflict)**  
Imagine you've been working hard in the gym, lifting heavier weights, and pushing yourself to your limits. You know it's time to take your gains to the next level, and bulking up seems like the perfect solution. But when you hear that you need to consume a whopping 3000 calories a day, it can feel overwhelming and confusing. What should you eat? How do you make sure you're getting enough essential nutrients without going overboard on junk food? Let's dive into this complex topic and find answers!

---

**(Act 2: The Solution)**  
Let's separate fact from fiction when it comes to eating 3000 calories for bulking. First off, not all calories are created equal; focusing solely on quantity while neglecting quality can lead to unwanted fat gain and hinder overall progress. A balanced approach is crucial for optimal performance and muscle growth. Here are some tips to make your bulking journey smoother:

1. **Plan ahead:** Create a meal plan that includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods like lean proteins (chicken, fish), healthy fats (avocados, nuts), whole grains (brown rice, oats), fruits and vegetables – these will provide energy for workouts without excessive fat gain. Don't forget protein shakes or bars as convenient options between meals!
2. **Eat frequently:** Instead of three large meals per day try consuming smaller portions more often - this helps maintain stable blood sugar levels which in turn prevents cravings while keeping metabolism active throughout the day. Aim for five-six smaller meals rather than sticking rigidly with traditional mealtimes! 🕒🍽️👌🏼
3. **Stay hydrated:** Drinking enough water is essential not only during workouts but also between them – proper hydration supports digestion & nutrient absorption making sure every calorie counts towards your goals! 💧💪🏼✨️👌🏽 Check out these hydration tips too: [link_to_article]! 😉 #hydrationhacks #staythirsty #stayfit 😉" />" />" />```css" />```
